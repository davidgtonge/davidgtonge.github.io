This is a new blog that I've setup using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
I like the idea of being able to write in markdown and deply via Git -
we'll see if it actually enables me to write more!

Jekyll is actually quite limiting - I miss my Handlebars helpers. The only reason I chose it was because it is supported
by GitHub pages.

The theme for the blog is based on [Midnight](https://github.com/blog/1081-instantly-beautiful-project-pages), one of
the themes for GitHub's automatic page generator. I made a few adjustments (I found green buttons with white text
fairly unreadable), but its generally a very nice theme.

Anyway on to a real blog post...
